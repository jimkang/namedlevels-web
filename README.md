==================

This app displays randomly generated classes with old-school named levels (like in 1st Edition AD&D).

Installation
------------

    npm install
    npm install wzrd -g

Usage
-----

    make run    

Or run [wzrd](https://github.com/maxogden/wzrd) directly:

    wzrd index.js

Then, wzrd will say something like:

    wzrd index.js
    server started at http://localhost:9966

You can open your browser to that.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
